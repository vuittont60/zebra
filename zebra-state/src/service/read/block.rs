//! Shared block, header, and transaction reading code.
//!
//! In the functions in this module:
//!
//! The StateService commits blocks to the finalized state before updating
//! `chain` or `non_finalized_state` from the latest chains. Then it can
//! commit additional blocks to the finalized state after we've cloned the
//! `chain` or `non_finalized_state`.
//!
//! This means that some blocks can be in both:
//! - the cached [`Chain`] or [`NonFinalizedState`], and
//! - the shared finalized [`ZebraDb`] reference.
